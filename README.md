This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that uses the [Deno Subhosting API](https://deno.com/subhosting) to allow users to run code written in a cloud IDE.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to open the IDE. Enter any JavaScript code and press Run.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
